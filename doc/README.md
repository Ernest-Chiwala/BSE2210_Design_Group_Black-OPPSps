*Reflection on AI Usage

We used AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Deep seek,) to brainstorm structure and ideas for diagrams, explanations, and report formatting.  
However, all final content was refined, validated, and contextualized by our team to ensure originality and academic integrity.  
This means that while AI supported us in ideation, the analysis, decision making, and explanations remained human driven.
